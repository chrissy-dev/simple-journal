## How to use 

### Creating an entry 

An entry is simple a page in the log. They are basic markdown files with minimal required meta data.

**You can only have one entry per day**

All entries live within the `./src/entries` folder. You can organise this folder and name the files any way you want, although it's recommended you use some form of dates in your file name to keep track. 


To create an entry for *"25th Feburary 2021* create file called `2021-02-25.md` in `./src/entries/` and copy the following:

```yml
---
name: Wild Camping at Loch Ossian # Required 
date: 2021-02-25 # Required

summited: true|false # Optional
munro: true|false # Optional
camping: true|false # Optional
dug: true|false # Optional
---

Body content here, ~you~ can use *markdown*.
```

### Adding images to an entry

Log looks for images stored in `./src/assets/images/entries/**` to check for a folder matching the date of your entry. 

To add images to the above example create a folder matching the date of your entry in `./src/assets/images/entries/2021-02-25` and add your images.
